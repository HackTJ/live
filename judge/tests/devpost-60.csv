Best Web App,Dealight,https://hacktj2019.devpost.com/submissions/117726-dealight,"Inspiration

As high school students, we do not have an unlimited budget when shopping, meaning that we have to be smart with our money. That means we are constantly looking for the best deals online. Although there are some websites online that give deals for certain sites, it is insufficient to only have such a limited range of retailers to consider deals from. This is why we were inspired to make our own websites that not only finds the best deals but also has a user-friendly UI.

What it does

Dealight looks for the cheapest deal for the specific product you request. If you are looking for something more general (e.g. Earbuds), we have an algorithm that will take into account both price and review.

What we learned

What's next for Dealight

What we made during this hackathon was a website that was able to take advantage of the online retailers that already have a search API built into their websites. In the future, we want to expand to all types of websites that don't have their own search API so we can take advantage of as many deals as possible.

We plan to compete for Best Beginner Hack.

In CS we learned about sorting algorithms but the way that it was explained to use made it unclear. We decided to try and remedy this by creating an app to teach different sorting algorithms.

Best Web App,Course Selector,https://hacktj2019.devpost.com/submissions/117742-course-selector,"Inspiration

Getting our courses after we've requested takes a long time and by automating the process we can get our courses before the end of the previous year and plan over the summer. We were also inspired by the difficulty of switching your classes and that if you get all your hard classes on one day there's nothing you can do because it's so hard to manually switch courses. By automating this process we can make the whole school year more manageable for students.

What it does

There are two parts to our website, a part for students and a part for teachers. You need to use your fcps account to log into either part. In the teacher part, two things can be entered, what teachers teach what courses in what periods and student course requests. (We decided to make student course selection done through the teachers because we felt that it was important student talk to counselors about their courses so this ensures that actually happens.) In the student part, you can view what your schedule is and also request course changes. (When requesting course changes you must also give a reason and that reason must be manually approved before your course is changed.) If the course change is approved then the system finds students that you can swap with (they will still have the same courses just in a different order) and you will have to manually ask them if they are willing to change courses and if they accept then their courses are changed.

We used HTML and CSS to program the website, which we taught ourselves at the beginning of this event through a Code Academy course. We all are athletes who strive to be in shape and ready for our sports season, and with this efficient and motivating website, we and all other people desiring to exercise certain muscles can achieve their goals.

From 2010 to 2017, the homelessness counts in Los Angeles County increased by a staggering 42%, ranking it 2nd in the list of cities with the highest homeless population. It also has the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless citizens than any other city in the United States at 75%. Although New York City has the highest population, its unsheltered percentage is only 5%. A common issue among homeless communities is the lack of awareness of the resources throughout major cities that are provided to ensure their safety and well-being. 

What it does

This connects people with unstable living conditions to resources such as free clinics, food banks, or community shelters in their city. Once they find the appropriate resource ConnectLA will specify any requirements and provide the directions to the facility.

MLH: Best Use of Blockstack,Dēmos,https://hacktj2019.devpost.com/submissions/117793-demos,"Inspiration

According to Forbes, only 34 percent of American voters can name the three branches of the federal government. When it comes to making informed political decisions, the statistics are even more frightening. Political ignorance and low turnout are on the rise and are threatening the foundations of democracy. We created Dēmos (the root word for democracy in latin) because we recognize the need for an easy way for citizens to 1. Make real-world change, 2. Vote in a secure way, and 3. Make more informed decisions

What it does

Dēmos offers three services - Blockstack and GPG-based secure voting, curated news about the most important recent events, and an easy way to make political change through contacting your representatives

A lot of students struggle with getting into college. Our app helps decides reasonable places to go to. We were inspired by our own inner struggles along with what our siblings went through in the past. We wanted to know where we could go to college based on your PSAT/SAT scores, our ACT scores, and our weighted GPA.

What it does

Our app sorts out reasonable colleges based on PSAT/SAT scores,  ACT scores, and weighted GPA. It will then sort our the colleges based on distance, rank, cost.

How we built it

We used android studio to build this app. Split up the work in order to speed up the proccess of creating the app.

Challenges we ran into

Due to us splitting up the work, it was difficult for us to synchronize all of our work onto one platform.

Food production is what drives the development of the world. In many third-world countries, the crop yield isn't sufficient to satisfy the needs of an ever-growing population. We decided to pursue the difficult task of solving this issue, and created Cultivate the World.

What it Does

Our system involves a network of low-cost, portable weather stations, which are easy to manufacture and distribute throughout the planet. These weather stations harvest data about the environment, including parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, air pressure, wind speed, and more. The data is then sent to a central sever, and then processed using machine learning techniques in order to predict useful weather patterns and warn farmers of impending weather formations that may cause crop failures.

How We Build It

The raw data is packaged using a Raspberry Pi Zero, a small and efficient computer. Data packets are then sent over an existing radio network, such as GSM, or our own network, like APRS with QPSK. We leverage cloud computing to centralize this enormous amount of data, and process it effectively. We use an LSTM (long-short term memory) recurrent neural network with dynamic weight matrices (implemented using genetic algorithms) to properly interpret the data and detect relevant patterns. Depending on the network coverage of the area, we would either use WiFi, GSM, or APRS to communicate the weather analysis back to the farmer.

Best Social Impact Hack,HelpingHand,https://hacktj2019.devpost.com/submissions/117849-helpinghand,"Inspiration

As students, we have been taught the importance of getting help as soon as possible when it is necessary. This is why we wanted to create a website for people to find the help they need, no matter what problems they may have.

What it does

This website allows users to effectively navigate to a sources in which they can find a support group for themselves or their friends.

How we built it

We built this website using html and java script.

Challenges we ran into

We were not familiar with the languages needed to create this website, so we had to spend time learning.  We also had to manage our time properly so that we could fit in the many steps needed to create our website.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that even though we were not familiar with our coding language, we persevered and continued to learn in order to make a successful output.

What we learned

We learned how to use html and javascript to create a fully functioning website.

What's next

In the future, we plan on expanding this website and spreading its outreach to anybody who may need help.
