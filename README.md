# HackTJ Live
Live is a massively scalable application for realtime hackathon judging and mentoring.

## Why?
HackMIT has built several hackathon management solutions over the years. [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) has advised us to have a backup spreadsheet in case Gavel breaks day-of, as it has in the past. We wanted a solution that scales. 

The HackTJ Live judging app is heavily inspired by [Gavel](https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel) and the mentoring app is heavily inspired by [HELPq](https://github.com/ehzhang/HELPq) and GitHub issues.

## Usage
Students interact with the mentoring app by asking questions; mentors interact with the mentoring app by answering questions. Judges interact with the judging app by judging projects. Some notes:
- students do not interact with the judging app. If you want `/judge/scoreboard` to be viewable by students, this can easily be changed.
- judges do not interact with the mentoring app and mentors do not interact with the judging app (obviously).
