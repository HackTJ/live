# HackTJ Live
Live is a massively scalable application for realtime hackathon judging and mentoring.

## Usage
Students interact with the mentoring app by asking questions; mentors interact with the mentoring app by answering questions. Judges interact with the judging app by judging projects. Some notes:
- students do not interact with the judging app. If you want `/judge/scoreboard` to be viewable by students, this can easily be changed.
- judges do not interact with the mentoring app and mentors do not interact with the judging app (obviously).
